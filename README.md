A natural language to SQL translator with Streamlit-UI, backed by an SQLite database./n
Users can ask plain English questions such as "Show me all orders from John Smith in July 2025", and the web app will parse the query into SQL, fetch the results, and display them. It will also display the query it generated, allowing the user to learn more if they wish. Users are able to add and remove records to the database in a user-friendly way, and the app does all the back-end database work.
